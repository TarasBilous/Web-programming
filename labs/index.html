				<h1>General</h1>
				<p>Team Liquid is a professional team, founded in the Netherlands in 2000. Originally a Brood War clan, the team switched to StarCraft II during the SC2 Beta in 2010, and became one of the most successful western teams. On December 6, 2012, it was announced that the team had formed a Dota 2 division.</p>
				<p>Team Liquid is also strongly associated with its website, TeamLiquid.net. Launched on May 1, 2001, it has developed through the years into a focal point for StarCraft and Dota 2 coverage, eventually becoming the most-browsed StarCraft-related website in the world, gathering thousands of members (including several professional players) and centralizing news about the global SC2 scene. On August 30, 2012, Teamliquid.net announced expansion into Dota 2 coverage.[2] The website also features a progaming database, the TLPD, as well as a wiki dedicated to Brood War, StarCraft II, Hearthstone, Dota 2, Super Smash Brothers: Melee, Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch, Liquipedia.</p>
				<h1>History</h1>
				<img src="images/wining.jpg" alt="winning" class="win-image">
				<p>The team's original incarnation has roots in a North American lineup headed by FLUFFNSTUFF called FIRE, that went on to represent compLexity Gaming at The International 2012. Following an early knockout, the coL squad disbanded with TC, ixmike88, and FLUFFNSTUFF moving over to Liquid and joining BuLba, who competed at TI2 with Evil Geniuses, and Korok, formerly of Quantic Gaming.</p>
				<p>In 2013 the team established itself as one of the premier North American organizations with this roster, placing highly in events such as the Raidcall D2L, The Defense, The Premier League, and the American Dota League in addition to securing an invite to The International 2013. After a rocky start they fell into the lower half of the bracket by a thin margin, which saw them defeat MUFC and then had one of their defining moments in a stellar performance against LGD.cn, knocking the Chinese behemoth out of the event. A loss to the defending champions Invictus Gaming saw them out in 7-8th place.</p>
				<p>After the event the roster changed once more, with ixmike going inactive to focus on ixdl, and Korok leaving for school. qojqva of mousesports and Waytosexy of Dignitas eventually filled the ranks. After a strong start in online leagues and group stages, the team had major stumbles at both Fall LAN events, falling early at both MLG Columbus and DreamHack Winter. By early Winter, the team started to falter in it's online play as well, with the frustration boiling over and being shown by FLUFFNSTUFF on his TL.net blog.[3] The blog resulted in an ultimatum for FLUFF: win as captain, or be removed from the team.[4] The team failed to improve, and Liquid soon parted ways with Fluff.[5] After trialing a few players, including Sneyking, DeMoN was added to the roster to take his place.</p>
